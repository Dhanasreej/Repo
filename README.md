I got, I got, I was considered two softwares, like one is SAP BO, another is Report Builder. So now we are doing a SAP BO to Report Builder migration project. So for that, a task was given to me, which is like, I was given with the SAP BO report, and that had object filters, sorry, object fields, query filters, and report level filters, and a sample field. So I need to recreate this into a report builder. Like I need to recreate this in Report Builder, like a report. So for this, I just hovered over those object fields in SAP BO, and I found like which table they are present. And in Report Builder, I connected a database, like I connected one schematic model, semantic model, and in the dataset side, I touched the dataset and I gave add dataset. And in add dataset, I chose the semantic model in the data source, which I chose earlier. And in the query part, I chose like query designer, and I chose that and I went inside, and based on those SAP BO details, like I just hovered over those SAP BO object fields, and I just found those fields, like in which table those fields are present. And I took them as reference, and I tried to add those fields in Report Builder in order to create a report there. But here what the problem is like, I added those fields, but when I tried to apply the filters in such part, I couldn't, like I'm getting no, like after adding all the queries, I'm getting, lastly I'm getting no rows as output. Like when I try to execute, I'm getting no rows. So here, so that I asked all other, I searched online, like I asked ChatGPT, the ChatGPT there, and I just run only the filter part alone. Even though I run them, like the total, for example, if I gave payer key is equals to 1006.7P, and I just chose all the payer key count, both look similar. Like their count are looking similar and mail date, like another field is there. And I applied a filter in that field also. And when I tried to apply the query there and found like their count also looks similar. So here, the filters doesn't work properly. So that ChatGPT told like, your data are not connected properly and that's why you are getting, like your relationship, there is no relationship between the payer claim key. Like now consider, like the query will be having multiple tables and the values from claim detail key, sorry, claim detail table, pairs table, task table, task type key table, milestone dates table, like I forgot that milestone alone, but it ends with, starts with M and ends with the dates, that table, and audit level table. So it has these many tables. So I included the fields from these tables and at last, I needed to include the filters that should filter only the either, like... That should filter either only the like one is the uncondition. First thing is like the pair key should be equal to 1670 and the next is like it should either have the one date, April 1 received date is equals to yesterday or the next is like milestone date is equals to yesterday and the milestone date is equals to 64. So the first is uncondition, the next is R condition and within that R condition, the second one has like the two things. So this is what it gave. So like when I tried to run the whole thing, I am not getting anything. Like the no rows was given. So here the filter, so I asked to ChatGPT and told like the filter condition doesn't work properly. So in order to find, in order to find, it asked me to run only the filter part. So I tried to run only the filter section like and I tried to find like whether the count matches with the original all count or it's like it got reduced. But the count got matched. If I get the pair ID, count of pair ID is equals to 113, the filters, the pair ID is equals to 1670. That count also matches with the 113 and the same for milestone. So here the filter doesn't apply properly. So my thing is like, how to figure it out? And I need to create a report using this. So tell me like, how can I make it possible?
Consider this, like I'm trying this for the past two days. The task was given to me yesterday evening and I didn't even complete this until today and I need to give this by Tuesday since Monday is a holiday and just don't consider that. Like I need to give this by Tuesday and I can't work this for the next three days since it is Saturday, Sunday and Monday and I don't get those things to my home because I was just given with my TC and I don't carry laptops. So just keep that on the other side. Like just assume like the claim details table will have payer key and those tables also have provider table and the claim details, first consider this alone. The claim details table will have payer key, provider key, then some keys. And in the milestone dates table, there is the claim detail key. But when I try to use that, like it is showing like there is no such column exists in milestone dates table. So how can I rectify this?
But in milestone dates table, there is a claim detail key present there. But when I try to connect, but I don't get such, like it is showing like there is no column claim detail key present, like there is no column called a claim detail key in milestone. But when I look physically, like when I touch to expand the milestone dates in the left side, and I just see like there is a claim detail key column field present there. And in claim detail table, there are many fields like provider key, payer key, and appeal key, audit key, everything. It acts like one of the fact tables, and there is like another fact table also present. But I don't know like whether it is a fact table, and like I don't know like whether the claim detail key, claim details table is a fact table. And I have provider table, and the provider table have provider name, provider key, and provider related information. Payer table have payer key, payer short, payer description. The provider table also have provider description. And the next thing is like milestone table have appeal received, appeal one received date, appeal one response data, appeal two received data, appeal two response data, and another such dates, related columns. And it also has a one comma zero appeal one received date, one comma zero appeal two received data. And it had such kind of things, and it also had claim detail key inside. And then there were also called one table called a process the letters, and the process letter table has information related to that, and that also had, and I didn't check like whether it had claim detail key. So here what the issue is like, I don't know how to connect them in query designer, like the query looks different. It starts with evaluate, summarize columns, open bracket, and the The table's name, bracket, inside bracket, the name of the field inside the table. Likewise, I chose, then I gave comma. And at last, I used a filter, open bracket, values, pair key, pairs of pair key is equals to 1670, comma. Again, filter, open bracket, that those conditions, unconditioned, sorry, OR condition. Then, then second level, then, then such kind of things. Then I got some error. So I changed in pair key table, I changed the claim detail table. Likewise, so like here, how do, how can I connect in this, this structure? So please help me. And my guide told me, like, use, and she shared a sample, and that had some, some keywords like treat as and such kind of things. And I used in my code related also as well, but it doesn't work. The sample code also had a treat as distinct, count, unique, such kind of things. So help me, like, how to combine the tables and get my output. Please help me.
Sometimes the chatgpt there also asked to use aggregations but if I use i w not get row by row output and I have lots and lots of confusion 
It also shows like error in report Builder that there is timeout error and because chatgpt suggested to use aggregations
The output report should only have five to six fields and it also have report level filters and next is ise many fields in query designer because these are used SAP bo bthe output has only few fields so 
You understood what I have done so far
What should I need to do on Tuesday 
What I need to convey to my guide on Tuesday since I will have connect morning how to explain the issue and include whatever I tried so that could u derstand what I have done and I have done something 
Eventhoigh i u treatss i not getting output 
Payer key also return the same count 
Now see this, like I consider this, like I am getting the output, sorry, I am getting only the headers in the output. Like it is giving like when it gets executed, it is showing no response. So this is the error. So in order to rectify this, you are saying these much suggestions. So let me explain. I used claim details. I used like the output. It should have claim detail key, provider key, provider short, provider name, sorry, pair key, pair short, provider name, provider key, provider description, payer description, audit level key, process letters, appeal one received date, appeal to response date, appeal one response date, appeal to received date, and milestone dates and few fields from milestone dates. So here there's like claim details table separately. I have a separate table claim details. And I also have fact table, like that one table. So here I didn't take the value from the claim details table. Like I didn't take the claim detail key from the claim details table. I took the claim details key from the fact table in the like evaluate summarize columns, open bracket, fact table of claim detail key. And I took the other values from the respective tables. So here, when I, but here in the below, I thought like in filter condition, the payer, like when I try to check like whether the payer key also filters, I, I got the same count as like when I try to use the payer keys filter, I'm getting the same count with the like, which is similar to the totals total count without using filter. So if only here the filter is also not working. And as well as for the same milestone, milestone dates. So I thought like here, the relationship is not built properly. So instead of using payers in, inside filter condition, instead of using payers of payer key, I just thought to use the claim details of... So, is this correct? Like, in the beginning, I used fact table of claim detail key. So here I'm using claim details of pair key. So is this correct? I'm having a doubt in this. And also, like, when I, this is one thing I have done. So keep this in separate. Then I asked another AI and it gave some code using pre-test. So when I try to run that, I am getting timeout. So, can you just figure out, like, and it also told me, like, when I told this all the thing, it told, it told me, and another thing is like, the claim detail, the I have a milestone dates table, and that has claim detail key there. And the claim details table have pair key there. But uh but uh when I try to use uh milestones of claim detail key, it is showing like there is no such table. Like I just try to run that separately, like uh whether to find out like whether there is a milestone table, sorry claim detail key milestone tables, but there is no. But like uh but it is present on the left. Like I am getting I am getting confused. What should I do next? Because I need to get the output report. So what should I, like I told all the thing, like I am not getting error and the filter count doesn't match and I am getting timeout error when you use a pre-test. And what's the next step that I need to use?
And if I give columns names inside the tables can you figure it out 
Sorry, I forgot to add, like, the filter conditions are like, payer key is equals to 1670 and the data, like the appeal one milestone dates of appeal one received date is equals to air date, which is yesterday. Or the task type key is equals to 64 and another date column is equals to yesterday, which is in Like the audit, there is a table called audit result, and the audit result has root stuff key. There is a table called root stuff table, and the root stuff table has root stuff key and task type key. And the task type key, task type table has task type key and the respective descriptions. So the claim details table has audit level key, sorry, audit result key. So this is how it is related, but I'm not getting, so like in the previous given situations, add this like, add this, so this is what the situation.
Now see this, like, consider this, like, I'm getting the output, sorry, I'm getting only the headers in the output. Like it is giving like when it gets executed, it is showing no response. So this is the error. So in order to rectify this, you are saying these much suggestions. So let me explain. I used claim details, I used like the output, it should have claim detail key, provider key, provider short, provider name, sorry, payer key, payer short, provider name, provider key, provider description, payer description, audit level key, process letters, appeal to receive date, appeal to response date, appeal one response date, appeal to receive date, and milestone dates and few fields for milestone dates. So here, there is like claim details table separately. I have a separate table claim details. And I also have fact table like that one table. So here, I didn't take the value from the claim details table. Like I didn't take the claim detail key from the claim details table. I took the claim details key from the fact table in the like evaluate summarize columns, open bracket, fact table of claim detail key. And I took the other values from the respective tables. So here, when I, but here, in the below, I thought like in filter condition, the payer, like when I try to check like whether the payer key also filters, I got the same count as like when I try to use the payer keys filter, I'm getting same count with the like which is similar to the totals or total count without using filter. So if only here, the filter is also not working. And as well as for the same milestone, milestone stay dates. So I thought like here, the relationship is not built properly. So instead of using payers inside filter condition, instead of using payers of pay key, I just thought to use the claim details of. So, is this correct? Like, in the beginning, I used fact table of client detail key. So here I am using client details of pair key. So is this correct? I am having a doubt in this. And also, like, when I, this is one thing I have done. So keep this in separate. Then I asked another AI and it gave some code using tree test. So when I try to run that, I am getting timeout. So, can you just figure out, like, and it also told me, like, when I told this all the thing, it told it told me, and another thing is like, the client detail, I have a milestone date table, and that has client detail key there. And the client details table have pair key there, but, uh uh but when I try to use a milestones of client detail key, it is showing like there is no such table, like I just try to run that separately, like uh whether to find out, like, whether there is a milestone table, sorry, client detail key in milestone tables, but there is no. But like, uh but it is present on the left, like I'm getting I am getting confused, what should I do next? Because I need to get the output report. So what should I, like, I told all the thing, like I am not getting error and the filter count doesn't match and I am getting timeout error when I use uh tree test. And what's the next step that I need to use? Sorry, I forgot to add like the filter conditions or like payee is equals to 1670 and data like the appeal one milestone dates of appeal one received date is equals to airdate, which is yesterday, or the task type key is equals to 64. And another date column is equals to STD, which is in Like the audit, there is a table called audit result and the audit result has root stop key. There is a table called root stop table and the root stop table has root stop key and Task type key. And the task type key, task type table has task type key and the respective descriptions. So the claim details table has audit level, sorry, audit result key. So this is how it is related, but I'm not getting, so like in the previous given situations, add this like, add this. So this is what the situation.
I got a little confused, sorry. Like the filter condition, this is the final correct filter condition. Like the filter condition has payer key equals to 1670, and milestone dates like appeal one received date is equals to the yerday, which is yesterday. Or the task, like there is a task start date in task table. So that is equals yerday which is equal to yesterday and task type from task type table equal to 64 to which is from task type table. So here how it relates is like the task table has root stop key, and the root stop key, the task table has task key, the task key and the root stop key, and the root stop table has root stop key as well as task type key, and the task type table has task type keys. And audit result has task key. So this audit results gets connected with the client details table. So this is how it is related.
For your reference but it does not have all tables
